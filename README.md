## Game Plot

Year 2362. An astronaut scientist was sent on a mission to collect soil, air and water samples from a distant planet to find out if it can be inhabited by humans.
When he was landing on the planet his ship had some faults and it ended up destroyed in parts. Fortunately, the astronaut survived, and now his main mission is to find the parts of his ship in order to rebuild it and return to earth.

In his journey, the astronaut can collect samples to take to them to earth, and the more samples he finds, the more points he will earn. The idea is that each level ends when the astronaut finds a piece of his ship, and there will be approximately 7 levels.

Along the way, the astronaut will try to collect as many samples as possible, but it will not be easy because there will be alien enemies and other obstacles like black holes, wild strange plants and many other dangerous things along the way that will try to kill him. 

This game takes other games as a reference. Like Halo Games from Bungie and 343 Industries, Starfield from Bethesda, Gato Roboto from Doinksoft, No Man’s Sky from Hello Games, Jetpack and Lunar Jetman from Rare. And of course, Super Mario Bros from Nintendo. It also takes as a reference the contents of the course "Creating platform video games with Unity" by Steve Durán from Domestika.
